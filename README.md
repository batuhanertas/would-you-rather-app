# Would You Rather App

This project was built on the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter). This project is a simple game based on answering questions. The user has to choose an answer between two choices. Users are also allowed to ask their own questions. Users are listed in the leader board according to the sum of the questions that they asked and answered. 

This project requires only the following two steps to steps to be launched:

> npm install

> npm start
